The book demonstrates how most common statistical models (t-test, correlation, ANOVA; chi-square, etc.) are special cases of linear models or a very close approximations. This beautiful simplicity means that there is less to learn. In particular, it all comes down to \\(y = a \\cdot x + b\\) which most students know from highschool. Unfortunately, stats intro courses are usually taught as if each test is an independent tool, needlessly making life more complicated for students and teachers alike. By simple linear model, we mean models of the form \\(y = a \\cdot x + b\\). This aims to solidy my understanding of the original book by replicating the examples providing, and by adding additional background information to fill gaps in my knowledge. This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandocâ€™s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "]
